Description:
MEM Swift is an intelligent app designed to enhance the fan experience at sports stadiums. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the app allows fans to order food and beverages directly from their seats. It also provides personalized recommendations based on fan preferences, offering the best kiosks according to factors like price, delivery speed, and distance. The goal is to create a seamless, fast, and customized experience for stadium visitors, in line with the Saudi Vision 2030.


Features:
Food and Beverage Ordering: Fans can browse menus, place orders, and pay for food and drinks directly through the app. Real-time updates allow fans to track their order’s progress and expected delivery time.
AI-Powered Recommendations: The app uses artificial intelligence to recommend kiosks based on fan preferences, including price, delivery speed, and kiosk proximity.
Kiosk Locator: The app uses GPS to show nearby kiosks and help fans choose the most convenient options, ensuring accurate kiosk locations on the map.
Integrated Payment System: Secure and fast payments via an external payment gateway. Multiple payment methods are supported, including credit cards and digital wallets.
Seamless Integration with Stadium Infrastructure: The app works efficiently with existing stadium systems (food kiosks, delivery logistics) to ensure smooth operations and real-time communication.


How It Works:
User Registration: Fans can sign up or log in using their email or social media accounts. Profile customization allows users to set preferences (e.g., food type, delivery speed).
Ordering Process: After selecting a stadium seat, users view available kiosks and menus. AI recommends options based on preferences and location. Fans can place orders, pay, and track them in real-time.
Order Fulfillment: Once placed, the system forwards the order to the nearest kiosk. The kiosk prepares and notifies the system when the order is ready. A delivery person brings the order to the fan’s seat.
Feedback and Rating: After receiving their order, fans can rate the kiosk and delivery experience. The AI learns from feedback to improve future recommendations.
